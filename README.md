## Projects

### Proj1 â€” Basic Image & Video Processing
This project introduces core operations such as displaying images, capturing real-time video, and applying filters (e.g., grayscale, blur, edge detection). Key aspects include:

- **Reading and writing images**
- **Real-time video manipulation** with keyboard-triggered filters
- **Applying common transformations** (grayscale, sepia, Sobel filters)
- **Basic face detection** leveraging OpenCV
- 
### Proj2 - Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)
Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) focuses on methods for extracting features from images and finding matches within a dataset. The project involves several key steps:

- **Extracting and storing image features**
- **Calculating distances between images** using various metrics
- **Matching images** based on their features
- **Displaying the target image** alongside its closest matches

#### Tools and Techniques:
We explored various methods for image matching, including:
- **Color Analysis**
- **Texture Analysis**
- **Depth Information**
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN) embeddings**

Additionally, we tested combined approaches that mixed color, texture, depth, and DNN features. These combined methods often gave better results than using any single method alone.

### Proj3 - Real-time 2D Object Recognition
In this project, we focus on real-time 2D object recognition, aiming to detect and recognize objects within an image or video stream. The project utilizes modern techniques for feature extraction and machine learning models to classify objects in real-time.

#### Key Features:
- Real-time detection of objects in video
